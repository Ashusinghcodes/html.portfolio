<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I’m a student with a strong interest in technology, especially in how systems work under the hood. I keep a disciplined routine, balancing my studies with regular workouts and a drive to continuously improve. I enjoy exploring the technical side of things, particularly areas like computer architecture and system organization.</p>

<p>I live on a modest budget and handle my finances with care, making sure to stay on top of essentials while managing an active EMI. It’s taught me the value of planning, consistency, and prioritizing what truly matters. That same mindset carries over into my studies and personal development.</p>

<p> For me, growth comes from discipline, curiosity, and adaptability. Whether I’m training in the gym, prepping for exams, or just managing everyday life, I stay grounded with a focus on long-term progress. Always learning, always moving forward.</p>
